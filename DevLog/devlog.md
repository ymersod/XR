**What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?**
The terminologies have in common that they all are immersive experiences between the real tangible world and the virtual world.
The terminologies are on spectrum which includes how much of the 'view' is virutal.
A concrete description of the 5 milestones of the spectrum:
- **AR**(Augmented Reality) Is an overlay where digital objects is put on a view of the real world.
- **VR**(Virtual Reality) The view of the user, is entirely virtual.
- **AV**(Augmented Virtuality) Bring reality/physical objects(tables, people etc) into a virtual world.
- **MR**(Mixed Reality) Blend of VR and AR.
- **XR**(Extended Reality)Is an umbrella term, that describes all the different types.

**How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?** 
The most important thing XR applications provide is a larger immersion factor for the user. One of the ways XR accomplishes this is by playing on the human sense, at the moment the sense of sight is the most prevelant difference between. The sense of feel is also being utilized by using the users body as an input in XR applications(etc vibrations in controller), however this is not as perfected yet.

**Advantages/disadvantages?**
**Adv**:
-Processing information about various topics(etc ikea furniture placement)
-Fitness and workout(etc games requiring lots of movement, vr trainers)
-Communication in the virtual world feels more authentic than(etc discord, zoom)

**Dis**:
-Area consuming
-Pricy equipment
-Still lacking a bit in the 'immersion' department

**What use cases does XR have?**
-Processing information about various topics(etc ikea furniture placement)
-Training for specific tasks(etc heavy machinery, 3d modelling)
-Fitness and workout(etc games requiring lots of movement, vr trainers)

**How does XR add value to the end user?**
-Processing information about various topics -> time saving
-Training for specific tasks -> Less stress in training, more authentic than what propably would be 'observing' a lot or following instructions on a paper
-Fitness and workout -> Gives a more 'fun' fitness experience, also more authenic when incoporating a vr instructor

**How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of 
the technology?**

**Out idealistic vision for VR:**
_A fully immersive 'deep dive' version of XR where, the person exists only in the virtual world while in the virtual world as if being fully present in that world._

In our opinion we are far from it, the only thing that feels very close to our vision is the visual aspect of VR


**Out idealistic vision for AR:**
_Virtual objects that exists that exists in physcial plane, which does not require a screen to be seen/interacted with(etc holograms)_

From our deep researh we are still decades away, but we are closer to having an illusion that almost acts as a 'hologram'

**How does immersion and presence factor into XR?**
Immersion/presence is the key point of XR, if the user doesn't feel like the virtual world/objects are real it has not yet achieved it's peak use in our humble opinion.

**How is input technology and interactions different in XR?**
As explained earlier the input is using the users own body instead of a (screen/keyboard etc) 

**What problems can XR solve?**
-Reducing costs of training for tasks
-Reducing costs for getting help for various tasks
-Connecting more authetically with people from all over the world
-Easier/funnier way to exercise
-Time saving in menial tasks
