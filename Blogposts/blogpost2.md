## First Week
### 24/09/2024 + 01/10/2024

#### Project Summary
Welcome to Project Schoolmon.
The goal of the project is to make students across subjects to interact more with each other.

To achieve this goal we are making a game called Schoolmon

Schoolmon is an AR project that uses the players subjects in their education as their schoolmons, they can then fight other students/players to catch more schoolmons.

Players / students will be battling each other using their respective schoolmon, by answering trivia about the subject that their schoolmon represents.

Example: 

Player 1 - Software Engineer          - Extended reality

Player 2 - Global Business Engineer   - Team management

1. Player 1 uses an attack and has to answer a question relation to the XR course
2. Player 1 gets it right! The attack deals more damage!
3. Player 2 uses a HARD attack and has to answer a HARD question in relation to the Team management course
4. Player 2 answers wrong :( They miss their attack...
5. Player 1 uses a HARD attack.
6. Player 1 gets it right.
7. Player 1 WINS!!!
8. Player 1 can now catch the Team management Schoolmon!
9. The team management Schoolmon is added to player 1's team
